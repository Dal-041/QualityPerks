# QualityPerks
A set of wonderful bonuses for players in the game Starsector.
Quality Perks features "milestone" perks that are automatically awarded to the player when they achieve certain vanilla plot events, and are completely configurable. Quality Perks is a subset of the mod Quality Captains that allows other mods to modify the main skill tree while still awarding perks.
